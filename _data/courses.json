    "long_description": "<p><b>Advanced Training for Olympiad Mathematics</b> is a Bangladesh National Camp level course. Familiarity with all the basic topics and theories is required to benefit the most from this course. The difficulty of the course is pretty high, so a student should expect to spend at least 10 hours per week behind problem sets besides the usual class hours.</p> <p>This course is structured in a weekly basis spanning over twelve weeks. Each week will center around a certain topic or a certain group of problems that regularly appear on math olympiads. There will be two classes every week: one Theory class, and one Discussion class. Handouts will be delivered to the students after the theory class. The students are expected to try the problems before attending the discussion class, where the problems will be discussed in details.</p>",
